# Basic Setup

## Installing old versions
Installing old versions could not be simpler. All you need to do is join the [L4D Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/JAUCEJmm2H) and head to the #old-version-downloads channel. There, you will find a list of older versions of both Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 used in speedruns, with a description of their use case. These old versions will automatically come with SST (Source Speedrun Tools) installed, a tool used to easily record [demos](https://l4dsr.github.io/l4dsr-wiki/docs/tutorials/welcome/demos). A more detailed description for the use cases of older versions can be found in the [Game Version Glossary](https://www.speedrun.com/l4d2/guides/up099) guide on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/l4d2). To play old versions, simply open the game through the "Start L4D(2).versionnumber.bat" file, as seen here.   ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-12-17 162758.webp>)


## Recording demos
Demos are a lightweight in-game recording of your inputs and information your game receives from the server. They can be played back ingame, or parsed with external tools to assist in verification. Demos are ONLY recorded while loaded into a level, they do not record while on the main menu as there is no game server running.

- To record a demo, you can run the command `record demoname` before your run starts and begin playing. To stop a demo, run the command `stop`.
    - It is very highly recommended that you install [SST](https://mikes.software/sst/) to record demos. If you have installed an old version from the discord server, it should come pre-installed.
- Both demo and video recording are required for submission on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/l4d2).

## Recording video
While there are various ways to record your gameplay, it is recommended that you install a program like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to easily record your runs. If you would like to submit a recording of your run, it is required that you first upload it to a video sharing website such as YouTube to make your run visible. If you have livestreamed your run and wish to submit it through a website like Twitch, you must make a highlight of the run as they will expire within 2-8 weeks otherwise. It is also required that your video has game audio loud enough to be audible. If you have any further questions regarding video or demo recording, check the [rules](https://www.speedrun.com/l4d2?h=Main_Campaigns_Solo-Any_Difficulty&rules=game&x=5dwyr5kg-9l7p77l1.gq72p3n1) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/l4d2).



## Input overlay/display (Optional) 
Some runners may want their inputs displayed on screen during the recording of their run. An application such as [NohBoard](https://github.com/ThoNoht/NohBoard/releases) is recommended due to it's highly customizeable interface. Click [here](https://youtu.be/82kXJdJuM8k) for a basic NohBoard setup tutorial.
