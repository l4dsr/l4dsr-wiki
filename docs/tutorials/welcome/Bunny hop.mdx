## What is bunnyhopping?
Bunnyhopping is the combinaison of strafing and jumping at the 1st possible tick. Bunnyhopping is the essential technique to gain speed in this game. It requires a **LOT** of time and investment to be able to master bunnyhopping in the Left 4 dead Series.\
To understand Bunnyhopping, 3 notions are essentials :
  - Tickrate
  - Strafing
  - L4d Bunnyhop specifics



## Why should i learn bunnyhop ?

Bunnyhop is the most used technique in Left 4 Dead Speedrunning. not only you go fast but you can also :

  - Cross path not possible by simply jumping
  - Outruns commons (defaut speed for survivor is 200 commons is 220)
  - Clear maps faster.

:::Tip[Time consuming]
  It's important to notice that you have to practise a lot to be able to bunnyhop consistantly, it will require hundreds of hours to master the basics
:::

## Tickrate
* Tickrate is the sample rate which the game refresh all the data. to put it simply the higher your tickrate is, the more precise you have to be on your actions
* To know the  of time you have between each tick, do the multiplicative inverse of the tickrate to have the period of refresh

:::info[Source games tickrates]
  Here is a list of Source games common tickrate per seconds :
  * Left 4 dead 1/2 : 33
  * Portal 2 : 60
  * Team Fortress 2 : 66
  * Counter-Strike Source : 64
  * Counter-Strike 2 : 66
:::

**The tick rate is what define the jump timing** 


## Strafing
Strafing is the action of gaining velocity in the air by using your mouse and key strafe.
During your strafing towards a destination, you will be : 
  * Using the Q key for strafing left and moving my mouse to the left
  * Using the D key for strafing left and moving my mouse to the right

Strafing in Left 4 dead is really tight since you cannot freely strafe on high speed like half life games

:::caution
  Do not use your forward key while strafing forward.
:::

* L4d Bunnyhop specifics
Left 4 dead games also had some specifics regarding bunnyhopping which are :
  * Tick perfect bunnyhop (pressing 1 tick too late will lose you tons of speed)
  * Crouchhop/ Standhop (Crouchhop is better for slopes to gain speed but more forgiving if you miss)
  * Anti-spam hops ( Pressing space other than the tick you're touching the ground will cancel the hop)

:::info
Spacebar is mainly used by speedrunners to bhop but you can use scrollwheel, up to you 
:::

## Suggested practices/binds/methods
* You can learn strafing using SST autohop include in it `sst_autojump 1`
* Playing bhop specificaly maps  on left 4 dead 2 is not good for your muscular memory, train on the campaigns you are running
* Watch the route taken by top runners, they will show you the optimal bunnyhop route
* Watch aciidz tutorial if you have more questions otherwise ask on the discord.
